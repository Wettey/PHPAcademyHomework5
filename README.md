Task1

    Create x number (minimum 3) of classes that have viewAction() method that outputs class name
    in index.php in root of homework make a logic that randomly chooses one of those classes.
    Create a main App class (that is final) that based on random input (choosen class) given from index.php outputs their viewAction()
    Each class should have a namespace (some classes can even share a namespace if you like, but there has to be a couple of different namespaces).
    Put classes in directories how you feel it is right, but use multiple directories altogether.

Extra points

    Use interfaces and abstract classes where you feel they should go.
    Add Extra class Prefix that has only private properties (not methods). Set current date in one of the properties (example format: 09/09/2020).
    Add Prefix class to some new property of choosen class and prepend its date inside the choosen class before viewAction() output.
